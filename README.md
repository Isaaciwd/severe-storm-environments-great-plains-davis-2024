DOI:https://doi.org/10.1175/JCLI-D-23-0141.1

All figure data is in the "Data" folder, and code in the "Code" folder. There is a notebook for each figure which will recreate each pane of the figures seen in the paper.



Usage:

Clone the repository, and navigate into the Code directory.

Be sure to have an environment with NumPy, Matplotlib, Xarray and MetPy installed.

Running the notebooks will recreate the individual figures.
